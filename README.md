# Mobile
Goal: 
Create a small mobile-only web page section using a JS framework of your choice.

Goals & Judging Criteria:

Our goal is to develop the above given design into a web page. The first main thing we’ll be looking at is the attention to detail & how closely the result matches the design.

But of course, developing such a design is what many people can do. But, what is even more important in a company is to write clean, organized code that can be easily understood and updated by your teammates and seniors. We’re actually looking for something deeper here. So, a big part of the decision will be based on:

Code Style & Organization: How clean and organized your code is.
Simplicity of code: There are complex ways to write things and easy ways (e.g. floats vs flexbox). Are you able to understand a design and write simple and neat HTML and CSS for it, or are unnecessary elements and classes being used?
Familiarity with framework: If you use the features of the framework properly, and are not doing things in complex or strange ways.

Technology:
Framework: Use any framework of your choice. We prefer Vue, but you can use React or anything!
CSS Preprocessor is highly recommended. We use Stylus, but you can use Sass or anything else you’re comfortable with.
We don’t think anything like Bootstrap is required here. But, you can use something like tailwind for helper classes if you wish too.
Fonts: Ensure fonts and icons match the design exactly. Use Google Fonts and any other icon library you like.
Interactivity: There is a basic interactive element at the variant picker (i.e. 1 month supply vs 3month supply). It is optional to code it out, but there are bonus points if it’s properly done. It should be easy anyway if you are using a framework.
